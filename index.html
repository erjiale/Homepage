			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p> My name is JiaLe Qiu. I am currently a student at CUNY Hunter College aiming for a double major in Computer Science and Economics, and my expected graduation date is June 2020. I was born in New York City, but raised in Spain (Canary Islands), therefore, Spanish is my native language. I can also speak Mandarin and Fuzhounese because it is the language I use to communicate with my family.</p>
